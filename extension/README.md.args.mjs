Miniapp extension adds functionality to easily create a Farcaster/Base MiniApp. It will take care of manifest file generation at .well-known/farcatser.json as well as generation of the metatags required for miniapp rendering in Farcaster/Base feed.

Required steps:
- Copy packages/nextjs/.env.example to packages/nextjs/.env
- Run ngrok (or other) externally available tunnel
\`\`\`typescript
ngrok http http://localhost:3000 --url https://yoursubdomian.ngrok.dev
\`\`\`
- Update \`\`\`NEXT_PUBLIC_URL\`\`\` in packages/nextjs/.env for your domain
- Go to https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/preview , enter your app domain and click "Open URL as Mini App"

Your miniapp should render as a MiniApp in Farcaster Preview

For production you will need to generate the manifest accountAssociation values for your production domain and add them to the .env file (\`\`\`FARCASTER_HEADER, FARCASTER_PAYLOAD, FARCASTER_SIGNATURE\`\`\`). You can generate them using [Farcaster Manifest Tools](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest).

## ðŸš€Ponder Setup

This extension also allows to use Ponder (https://ponder.sh/) for event indexing on an SE-2 dapp.

Ponder is an open-source framework for blockchain application backends. With Ponder, you can rapidly build & deploy an API that serves custom data from smart contracts on any EVM blockchain.

### Config

Ponder config (\`\`\`packages/ponder/ponder.config.ts\`\`\`) is set automatically from the deployed contracts and using the first blockchain network setup at \`\`\`packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts\`\`\`.

### Design your schema

You can define your Ponder data schema on the file at \`\`\`packages/ponder/ponder.schema.ts\`\`\` following the Ponder documentation (https://ponder.sh/docs/schema).

### Indexing data

You can index events by adding files to \`\`\`packages/ponder/src/\`\`\` (https://ponder.sh/docs/indexing/write-to-the-database)

### Start the development server

Run \`\`\`yarn ponder:dev\`\`\` to start the Ponder development server, for indexing and serving the GraphQL API endpoint at http://localhost:42069

### Query the GraphQL API

With the dev server running, open http://localhost:42069 in your browser to use the GraphiQL interface. GraphiQL is a useful tool for exploring your schema and testing queries during development. (https://ponder.sh/docs/query/graphql)

You can query data on a page using \`\`\`@tanstack/react-query\`\`\`. Check the code at \`\`\`packages/nextjs/app/greetings/page.ts\`\`\` to get the greetings updates data and show it.

### Deploy

To deploy the Ponder indexer please refer to the Ponder Deploy documentation https://ponder.sh/docs/production/deploy

At **Settings** -> **Deploy** -> you must set **Custom Start Command** to \`\`\`yarn ponder:start\`\`\`.

And then you have to set up the \`\`\`NEXT_PUBLIC_PONDER_URL\`\`\` env variable on your SE-2 dapp to use the deployed ponder indexer.
